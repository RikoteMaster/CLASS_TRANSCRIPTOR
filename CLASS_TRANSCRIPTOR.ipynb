No, there what happens is that when you look at the first few years of exams, you will see that there are two types of problems. Of the first part, one that you have been leaving and the other that I have put. The one I put are all from Telecoade, except the last two years that Telecoade has given. The Telecoade you have put, I have put it. I If you see problems with the test, or problems where you get spirals and poles, that's not good. I'm going to finish this. foreign foreign In both ways, as I spent a lot of time on the first one, I think the topics are faster. I'll talk about the basics, then I'll do the topic. But the first exam is always the most important. Ok, now we are in the loop as a circular element. There are two groups of parameters, as a element and the cylindrical element. We are in the reciprocal system and we are in in that case we saw that its equivalent circuit was to provide a radiation resistance, a percussion resistance and a reactance. The reactance modeled by the reactive energy that was utilized by the antenna was one. The radiation resistance, the radiation power, and the other, the dissipated power in the form of a current. We also saw a coefficient, by the way, I said the de facto coefficient, well, the coefficient is when it is dimensioned. foreign and when I was teaching I was told that it was a reflection factor, not a coefficient. I was confused. We saw the coefficient of reflection, the coefficient of impedance adaptation and transmission, and the efficiency of sound loss. Now we are going to do it with its equivalent circuit. So, let's remember what we saw in circuit theory. In circuit theory, when we have a circuit, this is an active or passive circuit, because when the antenna works as a transmitter, it is a passive circuit. There is no power supply, there is nothing, it is passive. And there, its equivalent resistance, that is, its equivalent circuit, is an impedance, with its real part and its imaginary part. It is an impedance, without more. and a you the tension, the tension, not the interference, the tension. How was it done? Let's see, circuits first. How was the tension of the TEMI equivalent calculated? We had many meshes, after we put the IB there, we want to see the TEMI voltage. Open circuit. Open circuit. So we remove the rejector, the is is We have to connect the antennas to the circuit of the TV. We disconnect the excitation, which would be like giving it an incident, we do not put it and we see the relationship between voltage and current at the input. But for that we would have to excite, we would have to put something in the receiver to excite the antenna, without this, and what would be the relationship between voltage and current if we do that. The one we saw the other time, because it would be like having a transmitter antenna, where I put a transmitter and we would see the impedance of the circuit. is The antenna when it acts as a receiver. There is something that is a list of energy, there is a voltage source, but the impedance is the same as when it acts as a transmitter. In the MAIS that can be tested from the receptivity theorem, that the impedance of the antenna is the same in transmission as in reception. As I told you, a consequence of receptivity is that the parameters of the antenna are the same in transmission as in reception. This is the equivalent circuit. is that the antenna is resonating? energy In its whole, the fabric is neither capacitive nor productive. In its functioning, what happens is that if you think about it, this is a very dangerous film. Imagine that here is the waterfall. If I put a well here, foreign is because there is nothing that accumulates energy. This would be the equivalent of a capacitor, a coil, something that accumulates energy, but from half to none, because in the end there comes a moment when it is filled and that's it, the water continues. Something similar, I don't know if it's a good signal, but I imagine it more or less like this. When the antenna is resonant, it the core of the charge. The equivalent of the B-beam is this one. And here we are going to place the impedance of the charge. Or the impedance of the transceiver. The transceiver is passive. We are going to model it as an impedance. The transceiver is a digital impedance that can have its real part the foreign is So, that would be the power that... and we know that in ampere we are talking about the values of k. So, that would be the power delivered to the receptor. And the current, how much would it be? How much would this current be? The current would be V A divided by Z A plus Z L. Therefore, replacing the power delivered to the receptor would be R L divided by the module of 1 square root foreign If we want maximum transfer of power, what should happen? For the antenna to deliver the maximum possible power to the receiver, what should happen? In this case, what would be the received power, the adaptation of the impedance? In this case, this being so, it means that RL is equal to RA and that XCB is equal to minus XA. Therefore, the power we would receive in this case would be R sub T, which is R sub A. is Yeah is maximum that we can deliver. Where we will also take into account that the radiation resistance is the efficiency of the atomic energy by the resistance of the antenna. And therefore, in the reaction we will put the efficiency of the receiving antenna to distinguish the efficiency of the rejecting antenna from the rejecting antenna. We would have that, and supplying what would be the power that we would be delivering to the receiver. In case of impedance adaptation. yes So, the power we were referring to is this one. is in case of adaptation of impedance, that is, the power obtained in the case of adaptation of impedance by a coefficient, taking into account the loss of power by the adaptation of impedance in the rejection. And this coefficient, and this coefficient, if is ZA plus ZER squared. The reference is this one. And for this, you have to take into account the losses. Okay. What happens if we have many antennas? Together. For example, in a group of antennas, where we have many antennas, one antenna, another, and so on, many antennas, up to, let's suppose, n antennas. We have an antenna 1, an antenna 2, and an antenna n. In each antenna there will be a voltage at the input. We are going to call them V1, V2, up to Vn. Current line, we are going to call it V1, V2, Vn. is foreign For example, if the current in this antenna were zero, this antenna would not be fed, it would not produce radiation and of course it would not affect. But if I feed it, this will enter a current, it will produce a radiated field, that radiated field will propagate, reach here and induce a voltage. the the circuit the the What is the coefficient that relates one thingn n. These are the impedance parameters that relate the incoming voltages to each of the antennas. We can put this in matrix form. foreign foreign the the is So, Z1-1 is the ratio between the voltage and the current at the input of antenna 1 when the other antennas are not powered. And that is not the impedance of the antenna, that would be the impedance of the antenna when it is alone. That is called autoimperance of antenna 1. This is the autoimpedance of antenna 2. This is the autoimpedance of antenna N. and So, what we have here in red are the mutual inferences. And, for example, in general, the Z sub ij inference, how could we calculate it? How could we calculate, for example, Z1,2? I don't know, Zij would be in general, but let's think about Z1-2. To calculate Z1-2, what we would have to do is that all the currents were 0, 0, all but the current 2. That is, to measure only the current 2. And do U1 divided by I2 when we are only feeding the current 2. That is, it would be the influence of the current 2 I is the foreign I Okay? They are the same because they influence so much. Remember that I said that the same thing influences the B antenna in A, as the A in B. That's it. It's just that. This is to see how much the J antenna influences in A and the I antenna in B. It influences the same. That's always useful. It's a length of the foot. Another parameter, effective length, we are going to see it from two points of view. From the point of view of transmission, when the antenna is a transmitter and when it is a receiver. Let's see first in transmission, what sense does it have? The first thing to say is that this effective length only makes sense for wire antennas. Because what it is measuring is a length. If it is an opening, there is a length and a surface. Therefore, in principle, the length of the thread is for thread antennas. Let's look at transmission. In transmission, the radiated field, an antenna, we saw the vector of magnetic radiation, N. This is the general expression of the radiative field. But if it was a thread antenna, and this is the case because we are going to talk about the effective objectivity, if it is a thread antenna, and it is the case because we are going to give the effective objectivity, if it is a thread antenna, then there was only an electric radiation vector, not magnetic, because there was only an electric equivalent fictitious current, not magnetic. Therefore, in this case, the magnetic radiation vector is zero, There is no Lz or Lf. So what we had was... We had this, ok? We would have that. We would have that. And we, in the end, came to the conclusion that this, in the case of a current knot, in the case of a current nest, that ended up being... If it is in the z axis, this is in general for any thread, and if it is also in the z that it is a thread, there is no magnetic current fictitious. And if that thread is in the Z axis, it ends up being that. The effective length is defined in this way. I divide by the current at the input of the thread and multiply by the current at the input of the wire. It remains the same, right? Here we are going to do the same. No, no, sorry. That's it. I multiply the wire by the current. This is what we define as the effective length of the thread. The effective length of the thread is defined like this. Let's put it aside. The effective length of the thread is 1 divided by the input component by the components theta and phi of the normalization vector. The only one that exists, the electric one, because it's the thread. So, if there was an lgz, the loop, the thread, if there was an lgz, what would it be? Well, if we compare, notice that there is a minus sign, we are going to add a minus sign here and here. We put a minus sign here and here and we have not done anything. And then, if we match the two expressions, the effective length, if it is in the tangent axis, would be this. It would be at least the transform of the Fourier by the unit vector sine and by the unit vector theta. This is in general, and this is my case that it it is in the axis. What does the effective length mean? Well, let's see what it means. Let's see the radius of radiated field by a nest. We have said what is this. This is the radiated field by a nest. This is a constant, it is always the same. What was this? The spherical wave. A spherical wave with a constant amplitude. That does not distinguish some directions from others. A uniform spherical wave. What information does this give me? is the What is the effective length? What information? What do I need to know about the radiation wave of an antenna? I know the radiation power, I know it is a spherical wave, but what else do I need to know about the antenna? The radiation diagram and... That is the radiation diagram. The radiation diagram and... What is the difference between a dipole and a spiral? Of the same length? Because the radiation diagram is the same. is is This is the effective magnitude. It is an independent information that I radiate with more or less power. That's why we normalize by the current at the input. We divide by the current at the input so that it is something independent that I radiate 10 watts 40 or 50. And then this will be the same for any dipole that radiates more or less power. It will only depend on whether it is a dipole in the right magnitude with the distribution of current. foreign If the dipole was at the center of the rotation, it would be another discreet polarization, and the one at the center of the rotation is a stable pole. That is from the point of view of transmission. In reality, if you want, this is not what you want, but if I have a thread, for each possible direction of exit, the effective length would be the length that a thread would have that was oriented in this oriented in this way. The radiation of this thread in this direction is as if it were a thread with this length. In this direction it is as if it were a thread with this length. Therefore, the effective length depends on the direction of the thread. For example, this thread in this direction, as the radiation diagram is this and upwards there is no radiation, is equivalent to a thread of zero longitude, which does not produce any radiation. Then we give the effective amplitude in that direction is zero, and the effective amplitude in this direction is maximum. That is, it gives me the information of the radiation diagram. I don't know if you forget this, if you forget this, forget it. It is simply that it gives me the information of the diagram and the polarization. That is the transmission and the perception. is I have an incident and I want to calculate the voltage in open circuit, that is, the voltage of the antenna. I leave the antenna in open circuit and it can be shown from the recircuitous theorem, which we are not going to do. I Okay foreign the foreign is the direction through which the wave arrives, with respect to the local coordinate system of the antenna. is is And that will allow us to define the coefficient of polarization disagreement. foreign foreign is We have seen that V sub a is less than V sub b by the effective length. The antenna position can be expressed depending then the sine of minus is the same, because I have a square module that I can subtract. What I can do is, here is a scalar product. The scalar product, if they are parallel vectors, will be the product of the modules, squared, and if not, it could be zero. In other words, the scalar A by B is the product of A by B by the cosine of the angle they form. What we are going to do is to put this as the product of the modules, as if there were a polarization coupling. As if there were a polarization coupling, the scalar product would be the product of the modules. We are going to put it as if there was polarization. This would be the maximum possible received power. Maximum in the sense that it would be the power received with total polarization. With polarization, with the adaptation of impedances. the because if there was polarization coupling, this would be the product of the modules. And what do I have to add now? A coefficient that takes into account the losses due to the polarization coupling, and then those that I already had, that take into account the ohmic losses and that take into account the disadvantage of the influence. So what I have done is to put this as the product of the modules by a coefficient of the polarization coupling, is foreign I can say that my received power is the maximum possible received power, reduced by the losses due of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of longer a cosine of an angle when they are two linear, they are a cosine of a square of another angle in fact, now I put a table to explain this let's put an example For example, the antenna 1 transmits with linear polarization, vertical. And the antenna 2 with linear polarization, vertical. How much is the decoupling of polarization? How much? They are not decoupled. Then it is worth? One. Okay I is This is general, these are the particular characteristics circular polarization. And this is the linear polarization. I don't care if it's astrological or teleological. Okay? You can't answer with a minus. You have to know the ratio. But between what values would it oscillate? Between 0.5 and 1. This is a ellipse. Let's see the extreme values of the ellipse. If it's very small, it would be a line, and if it's very big, it would be a circle. is Okay. More things. Two circular projections with the same symbol. I I don't want to fill you with riddles, but take a piece of paper and roll it in your arm. Roll it in your arm. In a sense of a pillow. Come here. Come here on your feet. Let's see. Let's see. Let's put them from your point of view. As if you were transmitting. We put ourselves behind the film. If we put ourselves like this, the wave, as it moves, has to be there. We are in the electric field touching the cable. So I would do it like this. What is that? It is the dextrogy. Now turn around. Now you are the antenna to the receiver. And now I am the wave. So that it captures all the power, I have to turn at the same time as the cable, so I have to turn, I'm the wave that is coming, so to get to you I have to turn to the right. The point of view is everything. Ok, ok, so it's not the point of view that's everything. No. When you transmit, it's your point of view. Because you're transmitting and the wave comes out. The direction of propagation of the wave changes. It's not the same if the wave propagates outwards or inwards. When the wave propagates inwards, I see it turning right. But when I receive, I have to follow the direction of the wave. Not yours, I see how the wave comes to me. The projection is seen by seeing the wave moving away. So here I see the wave moving away and I see it turning right. And in turn, as I see the wave moving away, I see that it has to turn right to touch it. So, if it turns right, the two join. foreign is foreign In this case, if it were a line, 0.5, and if it were a circle, 0. So we are between 0 and 0.5. But the direction doesn't matter? It matters, but... In this case I'm trying to get away from it, and in this case I'm trying to get away move away too. The important thing is that it always sees it moving away. Always, always. The correction is when I see the wave moving away. So if I'm the transmitter antenna, I have to see it moving away, and if I'm the receiver antenna, I have to put myself here, in the direction of the wave's base and I see how it moves away. I can calculate with the formula that I use for polarization, foreign Okay foreign I I In that case, the refinite power is the power density incident on the antenna. So, Well, the maximum power that we can give to the receptor, assuming that all this is fulfilled, by definition is the power density incident in x2 by a parameter that we call the electric field. That is the definition of electric field. If you prefer, I think it is not necessary, but we could define the effective area as the maximum radiated power divided by... well, I don't know, I don't like to define it like that. The maximum radiated power is the... the watts per square incident, divided by the area. That's the definition. that, obviously, as this is the square field divided by 120pi by the refractive area, then this can be simplified and I have the effective area, clear, which is theta times the effective structure squared, divided by the resistance to the parameter. I'm going to take all this, I'm going to prime it, and I'm goingphrase it. This is the relation between the effective area and the objective. For any antenna, the maximum directivity is 4pi divided by 4. This is a consequence that is shown by the reciprocity theorem. The reciprocity theorem relates the transmission parameters to the reception parameters. Directivity is a transmission parameter, because it indicates how the receiver is receiving. And the receptive area is a reception parameter, because it indicates how it receives. There is a relation between how the receiver concentrates the radio to transmit and how the receiver concentrates it, which is this. It is the same information as directivity. is the relationship. And there is another interpretation of the definitive, if we develop it, which is the effective area would be the area that should have a constant illumination opening in The radiation from the field that radiates in that direction is equivalent to an opening with that size, with uniform illumination. If the illumination is not uniform, the difficulty of illumination decreases. You know that when it is uniform, the difficulty of illumination is 1, when it is not, it decreases. The physical certificate would be the surface that I would have to have in each direction, in a different shape, an opening aligned to the corresponding plane to produce the same radial field. That is why it is related to the effective length, because the effective length would be the length that the thread would have to produce that change. I'm Okay, so, the lighting efficiency in the case of a rectangular opening, a rectangular opening, is is foreign foreign This is the total radiation potential, so if the radiation diagram was this, this area would be the potential of the temperature, and the total area would be the radiation potential. And this would be the effective area of a parabolic transceiver, where there would be not only radiation a trajectory for the buoy. Okay. foreign the signal is the power that we are impeding to the receptor that we calculated before the power received, which would be the power that we have seen before received and the noise that would have here at the output of the antenna would be the constant of Dogman by the width of the antenna and by the temperature of the antenna. foreign And the temperature of the antenna, which is the noise that the antenna itself incorporates by thermal noise plus the noise of interference signals that the antenna captures, which can come from solar radiation, from the emission of the temperature of the antenna in a source, for example, imagine the sun, which produces radiation, and I see the sun as a solid matter, from my antenna, not only very small, but I see it as a solid matter, So is calculated as 1 over 4 pi, because the solid atom is integrated by this temperature, this interference that comes from the sun, the intensity it has, by the radiation diagram of the antenna, which would be weighted by the radiation diagram, and it is integrated in the whole solid atom. is is So we can calculate the temperature of the antenna or the contribution to the temperature of the antenna of an interference source such as the sun. If there are more interference sources, we would have to add another interference. If there is now a satellite around here, which is seen with a solid angle of the satellite, then we would have to add the same, but with the temperature of one of the satellite, the solid angle with which the satellite is seen and the directivity of the antenna. foreign Imagine that this receptor has a sensitivity that the signal is 40 dB. If the noise is too big, if it is less than 40 dB, the signal of the noise is no longer... And finally... The transmission station, let's remember it, because you have already seen it. Let's suppose we have two antennas, the transmitter antenna and the receiver antenna. We have a transmitted power here, a part of this is delivered, a part of this is dissipated, a part of this is radiated, from this, there will be a power finally delivered to the receptor. Here there will be a power dissipated. Here there will be a possible adaptation by polarization. And here there may be a disadaptation of impedances. Then we will have a distance R between the two antennas and we will also have a directivity of the receiving antenna, the transmitting antenna and the directivity of the receiving antenna. With all that, the transmission equation gives me the relationship between the transmitted power and the received power. A balance of powers of the entire complete radio link, from the transmitter to the receiver. is and So, what we are going to do here is to look at how we relate the received power with the transmitted power. correct correct? Let's continue. The radiation potential is divided by the distance between the transmitter and the receiver, whichated power is the transmitted power, reduced by 2, this is theissive power, to reach the radial frequency I have two losses, one and two. This is the difference in transmission and this is the difference in transmission due to the need of sonic losses. This is the radial force. And now, all this can be joined in one term, which is lambda divided by 4pr, all squared, by the directivity of the concept, efficiency, which is the sum of the sum of the perception. the and the transmitted power. Let's put it in order. In the end, we have the received power and the transmitted power. The more power transmitted, the more power received. That's the rule. If I give you 1000 watts, you give me 100 watts, you give me more power. This is something that increases the power. The more power transmitted, the more more radiation. Things that increase the power. The directivities of the transmitter and the receiver. The directivities of the transmitter and the receiver because they will be greater than one. Any antenna, like a coco, has one directivity. If it does not have more directivity, that increases. Why? Because the more directivity the antenna, the more concentration of radiation. With respect to an isotropic, which would radiate in all directions, and this one, which would receive all directions, the more direct, the better. I will receive more power because less will escape me by directions not of the cell. Therefore, we put below two things that raise the power. All this is are guarantees. The higher the received power, the better. Now, losses of power. I have losses of power due to misadaptation of impedance in transmission and reception. Losses of power due to sonic loss in transmission and reception. and and the other one is the receptor, because they don't have the same antennae. And finally, what is left? The energy is dispersed, and the greater the distance, the more energy is dispersed. All this is loss, all this is gain, all this is loss. The most frequent way to put this, and we have already finished, is to join the transmission directivity with the efficiency of sonic losses, and that gives rise to what? To the gain, because we have the transmitted power, the gain of the transmitter, this, we join with this, which would be the gain of the receptor and then we get the loss of free space, the polarization and the deviation of the transmission and the receptor. This is the most common form of the transmission equation. But this is also fine. I should've used a... I I'm going to ask you a question. This is the test that Alejandro put in the last exam he took. This is from April April 2023. Question 1. Is it good? How many hours do you have to do this? Three. Now, for the fifth. Okay. You don't have them without answers. I'm going to update it on the web without the marked answers Okay, let's see. The difference between the region of distant radiated fields and the region of close radiated fields is the region 3. And this is the region 2. Between the region 3 and the region 2, the difference is... I'm going to do it in it and take it to the evident. In the 2 and 3 regions, the fields have a square partition, in the 2 and 3 they have a square partition. In the 1 region, the fields have a radial component and an electric field, and in the 2 and 3 region they don't have a radial component. And the difference between the 2 and 3 regions is that in the 2 region the field varies 2 the distance varies and in the 3 it like this. Question 2, it says, the field of an antenna is E is equal to E sub 0 by L minus JKR by J divided by R squared by R unit plus 1 divided by r squared by r unit, plus 1 divided by r by kta unit. The polarization is... for a I I don't know if I'm doing it right, but... I know this is all in the book. This, not exactly, but I think you'll learn more. I'll tell you in the next day, I'll explain what I'm doing, but... I think you'll learn more, because if you don't see the same, you won't know what you're doing. I Yes. I Okay. is linear. So foreign I don't like this question. If I were a student I would ask, but are you asking me the third question? It's a weird question. I'm not going to do it because I don't like the way it is. Question four. For an antenna radiating in free space, which of the following parameter specifications is incorrect? The gain can be 0.5 in an antenna, it can be, but the directivity can not be 0.9, the directivity is always greater than 1. The isotropic would be a diagram in the form of a sphere with directivity 1, any other diagram that is a little more direct than a sphere, its directivity is greater than 1. Instead, as the gain is greater than 1, in to and the third book and the book about coprocolisation too. I have to say the height if you want. It's the same as this one, but with others... I want to see the antenna. No, no, no, no. A signal antenna. You dictate it to me. A signal antenna in the origin of the coordinate. Radius... Radius in a field of the form... I parentheses In polarization, there must be a wave that goes through the Y axis so that there is maximum polarization curve. Ok. Okay. This is the wave that radiates the antenna in the origin of coordinates. What we have to see is the wave that radiates this antenna in that direction with which polarization it comes out. We will have to particularize this in the direction of the FI, which is Tx equals pi by 2, which is Tx equals pi by 2, phi equals pi by 2. So we are going to particularize the wave carried by the antenna in Tx equals pi by 2, phi equals pi by 2. And then we would have, 0 to the power of pi is 1, so we have 1, because it is unit, plus j, 1, plus cos pi is 0, is equal to minus jkr divided by r. So, sub zero times theta plus j phi is equal to minus jkr divided by r. Then the wave radiated by my antenna in that direction of exit is this. What polarization does that have? Let's separate it into real part and imaginary part. The real part is vector and the imaginary part is phi. is because the options that you give with that We know that the cell of the bear is circular. I have to put here this wave that has to reach the circular polarization. Because this receives with polarization, receives with circular polarization, the domino has to reach with circular polarization. But the sign has to be the same. So we will have to see the sign of this. The sign is that P sub i, vector product of P sub r, goes in the direction of propagation. It goes in the direction of propagation better. If you want, you can substitute and check if it sounds more or less than zero. What I like to do is that I leave this one there, this is the X axis and this is the Z axis, my antenna is here, and the wave that scratches, this wave that comes out, that comes out, has a real part that goes in a dictum, and an imaginary part that goes in a function. foreign This is equal to negative R unit. This is r, almost never do it. If you want to do the question, I would draw it and I think you'll like it. I don't understand a problem from last year. Problem. I I have a question. When you read the radiation diagram, sometimes it was multiplied by the cosine that you were multiplying. And in that diagram, in the electric field that radiates, it is cosine of hecta plus 1 times f of kx times g of ky. Because that cosine of plus 1, is it not taken into account because there is already 1 and the cosine does not affect when you multiply? No, it is not taken into account. It is a diagram of this type. one If we have a current thread, this is the axis in which the wire is. If the wire is in axis z, it is in axis z. If the wire is in axis x, it is in axis x. And it will have a revolution symmetry around the axis in which the wire is. If the wire is there, it is in revolution symmetry. If the wire is in axis z, it is in axis z. If the wire is in axis x, it is in axis x. And if it is an opening, there is no revolution symmetry. is foreign The Z axis or the perpendicular to the opening. If the normal opening is outside the Z axis, the opening is here. And that is outside the Z axis. When it is a nest or a slot and we lower the invisible margin, this is where the nest or the slot is. And when it is an opening, this is where the opening is and this is outwards. In openings, the bottom part is the most important. Yes, yes, yes, this is where it is. Neither in opening nor in slot. Because there is no symmetry there. Ifs more than one, it with the graphical method, we get this. We say it's u and we draw 1 plus u divided by 2. We draw 1 plus u divided by 2 where u is the detector, U will vary between negative 1 and 1. And if we draw 1 plus U divided by 2, that is a line. Here it is 0.5 and here it is 1. is and now we go down the maximum, here one that was 1 plus 1 squared. No, it's like this. This is 0, this is 0.5 and this is 1. Because when u is 0, it's 5. When u is 1, it's 1. And when U is minus 1, it is 0. So, this is a wall. In this direction, I have a radiation wall. Here is 1. Here is 0 Z axis. There is a question from the group 3 that they give us. The diagram of the relationship between theta and theta is equal to minus 12, between parentheses, theta, divided by 15 degrees, squared. And that tells you to get the width of A to 3D. That's upside down. What? It's upside down. You should specify it. No, I don't copy it right now, but I suppose it could be. But it's negative. It's upside down. It tells you to calculate the width of A to minus 3D. Correct? Yes. Ok, then... correct 0 0 degrees. This is in degrees, right? 0 degrees. When the texture is 15 degrees, when the texture is 15 degrees, how much is it? Minus 12 degrees. The drop is minus 12 degrees. When the texture isC, it's the same. It's like this. This is the main hole. That's the main hole. That's the maximum. If I go 15º from the center of the eye, the Cdv have already fallen. This is the maximum radiation point, which is Tc equal to 0, that is, in the z axis, it will be a diagram that if we draw it in polar, this was the z axis, it would be a diagram of this type. With an eye like this, this would be the resolution symmetry, this would be 1 or 0 dv, 1, 1, 0, and when I go 15 degrees, it has already fallen to minus 2dB. Correct? The thing is that this is in Cartesian coordinates and this in coordinates around here. And they ask me for the h of A at minus 3 dB. Well, now we have to theta minus 3. We'll call this value theta minus 3. That's when you'll understand. So, minus 12 times theta minus 3 divided by 15 degrees squared equals minus 3. El menos con el menos me va. Teta menos tres partido por quince grados al cuadrado es igual a tres partido por doce, es lo mismo que un cuarto. Luego, theta minus 3 will be 15 degrees divided by 2. And the radius of the axis minus 3 db will be the double of this. The width of A to the power of minus 3dB is 2 times this, minus 3, which is 5. If you want I can do more. foreign If you give me tutorials, I will give you 4 different ones. If you give me 4 tutorials, I will give you 4. And if you give me 100, I will give you 100 per week. No. I I You can sit in the middle. I foreign But what I said was, if you, before the practice, teach them. If you wait for the practice, you let them pass. But if you pass presentation, but that's it, right? I'll be back. Okay.\"}\n",

No, there what happens is that when you look at the first few years of exams, you will see that there are two types of problems. Of the first part, one that you have been leaving and the other that I have put. The one I put are all from Telecoade, except the last two years that Telecoade has given. The Telecoade you have put, I have put it. I If you see problems with the test, or problems where you get spirals and poles, that's not good. I'm going to finish this. foreign foreign In both ways, as I spent a lot of time on the first one, I think the topics are faster. I'll talk about the basics, then I'll do the topic. But the first exam is always the most important. Ok, now we are in the loop as a circular element. There are two groups of parameters, as a element and the cylindrical element. We are in the reciprocal system and we are in in that case we saw that its equivalent circuit was to provide a radiation resistance, a percussion resistance and a reactance. The reactance modeled by the reactive energy that was utilized by the antenna was one. The radiation resistance, the radiation power, and the other, the dissipated power in the form of a current. We also saw a coefficient, by the way, I said the de facto coefficient, well, the coefficient is when it is dimensioned. foreign and when I was teaching I was told that it was a reflection factor, not a coefficient. I was confused. We saw the coefficient of reflection, the coefficient of impedance adaptation and transmission, and the efficiency of sound loss. Now we are going to do it with its equivalent circuit. So, let's remember what we saw in circuit theory. In circuit theory, when we have a circuit, this is an active or passive circuit, because when the antenna works as a transmitter, it is a passive circuit. There is no power supply, there is nothing, it is passive. And there, its equivalent resistance, that is, its equivalent circuit, is an impedance, with its real part and its imaginary part. It is an impedance, without more. and a you the tension, the tension, not the interference, the tension. How was it done? Let's see, circuits first. How was the tension of the TEMI equivalent calculated? We had many meshes, after we put the IB there, we want to see the TEMI voltage. Open circuit. Open circuit. So we remove the rejector, the is is We have to connect the antennas to the circuit of the TV. We disconnect the excitation, which would be like giving it an incident, we do not put it and we see the relationship between voltage and current at the input. But for that we would have to excite, we would have to put something in the receiver to excite the antenna, without this, and what would be the relationship between voltage and current if we do that. The one we saw the other time, because it would be like having a transmitter antenna, where I put a transmitter and we would see the impedance of the circuit. is The antenna when it acts as a receiver. There is something that is a list of energy, there is a voltage source, but the impedance is the same as when it acts as a transmitter. In the MAIS that can be tested from the receptivity theorem, that the impedance of the antenna is the same in transmission as in reception. As I told you, a consequence of receptivity is that the parameters of the antenna are the same in transmission as in reception. This is the equivalent circuit. is that the antenna is resonating? energy In its whole, the fabric is neither capacitive nor productive. In its functioning, what happens is that if you think about it, this is a very dangerous film. Imagine that here is the waterfall. If I put a well here, foreign is because there is nothing that accumulates energy. This would be the equivalent of a capacitor, a coil, something that accumulates energy, but from half to none, because in the end there comes a moment when it is filled and that's it, the water continues. Something similar, I don't know if it's a good signal, but I imagine it more or less like this. When the antenna is resonant, it the core of the charge. The equivalent of the B-beam is this one. And here we are going to place the impedance of the charge. Or the impedance of the transceiver. The transceiver is passive. We are going to model it as an impedance. The transceiver is a digital impedance that can have its real part the foreign is So, that would be the power that... and we know that in ampere we are talking about the values of k. So, that would be the power delivered to the receptor. And the current, how much would it be? How much would this current be? The current would be V A divided by Z A plus Z L. Therefore, replacing the power delivered to the receptor would be R L divided by the module of 1 square root foreign If we want maximum transfer of power, what should happen? For the antenna to deliver the maximum possible power to the receiver, what should happen? In this case, what would be the received power, the adaptation of the impedance? In this case, this being so, it means that RL is equal to RA and that XCB is equal to minus XA. Therefore, the power we would receive in this case would be R sub T, which is R sub A. is Yeah is maximum that we can deliver. Where we will also take into account that the radiation resistance is the efficiency of the atomic energy by the resistance of the antenna. And therefore, in the reaction we will put the efficiency of the receiving antenna to distinguish the efficiency of the rejecting antenna from the rejecting antenna. We would have that, and supplying what would be the power that we would be delivering to the receiver. In case of impedance adaptation. yes So, the power we were referring to is this one. is in case of adaptation of impedance, that is, the power obtained in the case of adaptation of impedance by a coefficient, taking into account the loss of power by the adaptation of impedance in the rejection. And this coefficient, and this coefficient, if is ZA plus ZER squared. The reference is this one. And for this, you have to take into account the losses. Okay. What happens if we have many antennas? Together. For example, in a group of antennas, where we have many antennas, one antenna, another, and so on, many antennas, up to, let's suppose, n antennas. We have an antenna 1, an antenna 2, and an antenna n. In each antenna there will be a voltage at the input. We are going to call them V1, V2, up to Vn. Current line, we are going to call it V1, V2, Vn. is foreign For example, if the current in this antenna were zero, this antenna would not be fed, it would not produce radiation and of course it would not affect. But if I feed it, this will enter a current, it will produce a radiated field, that radiated field will propagate, reach here and induce a voltage. the the circuit the the What is the coefficient that relates one thingn n. These are the impedance parameters that relate the incoming voltages to each of the antennas. We can put this in matrix form. foreign foreign the the is So, Z1-1 is the ratio between the voltage and the current at the input of antenna 1 when the other antennas are not powered. And that is not the impedance of the antenna, that would be the impedance of the antenna when it is alone. That is called autoimperance of antenna 1. This is the autoimpedance of antenna 2. This is the autoimpedance of antenna N. and So, what we have here in red are the mutual inferences. And, for example, in general, the Z sub ij inference, how could we calculate it? How could we calculate, for example, Z1,2? I don't know, Zij would be in general, but let's think about Z1-2. To calculate Z1-2, what we would have to do is that all the currents were 0, 0, all but the current 2. That is, to measure only the current 2. And do U1 divided by I2 when we are only feeding the current 2. That is, it would be the influence of the current 2 I is the foreign I Okay? They are the same because they influence so much. Remember that I said that the same thing influences the B antenna in A, as the A in B. That's it. It's just that. This is to see how much the J antenna influences in A and the I antenna in B. It influences the same. That's always useful. It's a length of the foot. Another parameter, effective length, we are going to see it from two points of view. From the point of view of transmission, when the antenna is a transmitter and when it is a receiver. Let's see first in transmission, what sense does it have? The first thing to say is that this effective length only makes sense for wire antennas. Because what it is measuring is a length. If it is an opening, there is a length and a surface. Therefore, in principle, the length of the thread is for thread antennas. Let's look at transmission. In transmission, the radiated field, an antenna, we saw the vector of magnetic radiation, N. This is the general expression of the radiative field. But if it was a thread antenna, and this is the case because we are going to talk about the effective objectivity, if it is a thread antenna, and it is the case because we are going to give the effective objectivity, if it is a thread antenna, then there was only an electric radiation vector, not magnetic, because there was only an electric equivalent fictitious current, not magnetic. Therefore, in this case, the magnetic radiation vector is zero, There is no Lz or Lf. So what we had was... We had this, ok? We would have that. We would have that. And we, in the end, came to the conclusion that this, in the case of a current knot, in the case of a current nest, that ended up being... If it is in the z axis, this is in general for any thread, and if it is also in the z that it is a thread, there is no magnetic current fictitious. And if that thread is in the Z axis, it ends up being that. The effective length is defined in this way. I divide by the current at the input of the thread and multiply by the current at the input of the wire. It remains the same, right? Here we are going to do the same. No, no, sorry. That's it. I multiply the wire by the current. This is what we define as the effective length of the thread. The effective length of the thread is defined like this. Let's put it aside. The effective length of the thread is 1 divided by the input component by the components theta and phi of the normalization vector. The only one that exists, the electric one, because it's the thread. So, if there was an lgz, the loop, the thread, if there was an lgz, what would it be? Well, if we compare, notice that there is a minus sign, we are going to add a minus sign here and here. We put a minus sign here and here and we have not done anything. And then, if we match the two expressions, the effective length, if it is in the tangent axis, would be this. It would be at least the transform of the Fourier by the unit vector sine and by the unit vector theta. This is in general, and this is my case that it it is in the axis. What does the effective length mean? Well, let's see what it means. Let's see the radius of radiated field by a nest. We have said what is this. This is the radiated field by a nest. This is a constant, it is always the same. What was this? The spherical wave. A spherical wave with a constant amplitude. That does not distinguish some directions from others. A uniform spherical wave. What information does this give me? is the What is the effective length? What information? What do I need to know about the radiation wave of an antenna? I know the radiation power, I know it is a spherical wave, but what else do I need to know about the antenna? The radiation diagram and... That is the radiation diagram. The radiation diagram and... What is the difference between a dipole and a spiral? Of the same length? Because the radiation diagram is the same. is is This is the effective magnitude. It is an independent information that I radiate with more or less power. That's why we normalize by the current at the input. We divide by the current at the input so that it is something independent that I radiate 10 watts 40 or 50. And then this will be the same for any dipole that radiates more or less power. It will only depend on whether it is a dipole in the right magnitude with the distribution of current. foreign If the dipole was at the center of the rotation, it would be another discreet polarization, and the one at the center of the rotation is a stable pole. That is from the point of view of transmission. In reality, if you want, this is not what you want, but if I have a thread, for each possible direction of exit, the effective length would be the length that a thread would have that was oriented in this oriented in this way. The radiation of this thread in this direction is as if it were a thread with this length. In this direction it is as if it were a thread with this length. Therefore, the effective length depends on the direction of the thread. For example, this thread in this direction, as the radiation diagram is this and upwards there is no radiation, is equivalent to a thread of zero longitude, which does not produce any radiation. Then we give the effective amplitude in that direction is zero, and the effective amplitude in this direction is maximum. That is, it gives me the information of the radiation diagram. I don't know if you forget this, if you forget this, forget it. It is simply that it gives me the information of the diagram and the polarization. That is the transmission and the perception. is I have an incident and I want to calculate the voltage in open circuit, that is, the voltage of the antenna. I leave the antenna in open circuit and it can be shown from the recircuitous theorem, which we are not going to do. I Okay foreign the foreign is the direction through which the wave arrives, with respect to the local coordinate system of the antenna. is is And that will allow us to define the coefficient of polarization disagreement. foreign foreign is We have seen that V sub a is less than V sub b by the effective length. The antenna position can be expressed depending then the sine of minus is the same, because I have a square module that I can subtract. What I can do is, here is a scalar product. The scalar product, if they are parallel vectors, will be the product of the modules, squared, and if not, it could be zero. In other words, the scalar A by B is the product of A by B by the cosine of the angle they form. What we are going to do is to put this as the product of the modules, as if there were a polarization coupling. As if there were a polarization coupling, the scalar product would be the product of the modules. We are going to put it as if there was polarization. This would be the maximum possible received power. Maximum in the sense that it would be the power received with total polarization. With polarization, with the adaptation of impedances. the because if there was polarization coupling, this would be the product of the modules. And what do I have to add now? A coefficient that takes into account the losses due to the polarization coupling, and then those that I already had, that take into account the ohmic losses and that take into account the disadvantage of the influence. So what I have done is to put this as the product of the modules by a coefficient of the polarization coupling, is foreign I can say that my received power is the maximum possible received power, reduced by the losses due of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of the square root of longer a cosine of an angle when they are two linear, they are a cosine of a square of another angle in fact, now I put a table to explain this let's put an example For example, the antenna 1 transmits with linear polarization, vertical. And the antenna 2 with linear polarization, vertical. How much is the decoupling of polarization? How much? They are not decoupled. Then it is worth? One. Okay I is This is general, these are the particular characteristics circular polarization. And this is the linear polarization. I don't care if it's astrological or teleological. Okay? You can't answer with a minus. You have to know the ratio. But between what values would it oscillate? Between 0.5 and 1. This is a ellipse. Let's see the extreme values of the ellipse. If it's very small, it would be a line, and if it's very big, it would be a circle. is Okay. More things. Two circular projections with the same symbol. I I don't want to fill you with riddles, but take a piece of paper and roll it in your arm. Roll it in your arm. In a sense of a pillow. Come here. Come here on your feet. Let's see. Let's see. Let's put them from your point of view. As if you were transmitting. We put ourselves behind the film. If we put ourselves like this, the wave, as it moves, has to be there. We are in the electric field touching the cable. So I would do it like this. What is that? It is the dextrogy. Now turn around. Now you are the antenna to the receiver. And now I am the wave. So that it captures all the power, I have to turn at the same time as the cable, so I have to turn, I'm the wave that is coming, so to get to you I have to turn to the right. The point of view is everything. Ok, ok, so it's not the point of view that's everything. No. When you transmit, it's your point of view. Because you're transmitting and the wave comes out. The direction of propagation of the wave changes. It's not the same if the wave propagates outwards or inwards. When the wave propagates inwards, I see it turning right. But when I receive, I have to follow the direction of the wave. Not yours, I see how the wave comes to me. The projection is seen by seeing the wave moving away. So here I see the wave moving away and I see it turning right. And in turn, as I see the wave moving away, I see that it has to turn right to touch it. So, if it turns right, the two join. foreign is foreign In this case, if it were a line, 0.5, and if it were a circle, 0. So we are between 0 and 0.5. But the direction doesn't matter? It matters, but... In this case I'm trying to get away from it, and in this case I'm trying to get away move away too. The important thing is that it always sees it moving away. Always, always. The correction is when I see the wave moving away. So if I'm the transmitter antenna, I have to see it moving away, and if I'm the receiver antenna, I have to put myself here, in the direction of the wave's base and I see how it moves away. I can calculate with the formula that I use for polarization, foreign Okay foreign I I In that case, the refinite power is the power density incident on the antenna. So, Well, the maximum power that we can give to the receptor, assuming that all this is fulfilled, by definition is the power density incident in x2 by a parameter that we call the electric field. That is the definition of electric field. If you prefer, I think it is not necessary, but we could define the effective area as the maximum radiated power divided by... well, I don't know, I don't like to define it like that. The maximum radiated power is the... the watts per square incident, divided by the area. That's the definition. that, obviously, as this is the square field divided by 120pi by the refractive area, then this can be simplified and I have the effective area, clear, which is theta times the effective structure squared, divided by the resistance to the parameter. I'm going to take all this, I'm going to prime it, and I'm goingphrase it. This is the relation between the effective area and the objective. For any antenna, the maximum directivity is 4pi divided by 4. This is a consequence that is shown by the reciprocity theorem. The reciprocity theorem relates the transmission parameters to the reception parameters. Directivity is a transmission parameter, because it indicates how the receiver is receiving. And the receptive area is a reception parameter, because it indicates how it receives. There is a relation between how the receiver concentrates the radio to transmit and how the receiver concentrates it, which is this. It is the same information as directivity. is the relationship. And there is another interpretation of the definitive, if we develop it, which is the effective area would be the area that should have a constant illumination opening in The radiation from the field that radiates in that direction is equivalent to an opening with that size, with uniform illumination. If the illumination is not uniform, the difficulty of illumination decreases. You know that when it is uniform, the difficulty of illumination is 1, when it is not, it decreases. The physical certificate would be the surface that I would have to have in each direction, in a different shape, an opening aligned to the corresponding plane to produce the same radial field. That is why it is related to the effective length, because the effective length would be the length that the thread would have to produce that change. I'm Okay, so, the lighting efficiency in the case of a rectangular opening, a rectangular opening, is is foreign foreign This is the total radiation potential, so if the radiation diagram was this, this area would be the potential of the temperature, and the total area would be the radiation potential. And this would be the effective area of a parabolic transceiver, where there would be not only radiation a trajectory for the buoy. Okay. foreign the signal is the power that we are impeding to the receptor that we calculated before the power received, which would be the power that we have seen before received and the noise that would have here at the output of the antenna would be the constant of Dogman by the width of the antenna and by the temperature of the antenna. foreign And the temperature of the antenna, which is the noise that the antenna itself incorporates by thermal noise plus the noise of interference signals that the antenna captures, which can come from solar radiation, from the emission of the temperature of the antenna in a source, for example, imagine the sun, which produces radiation, and I see the sun as a solid matter, from my antenna, not only very small, but I see it as a solid matter, So is calculated as 1 over 4 pi, because the solid atom is integrated by this temperature, this interference that comes from the sun, the intensity it has, by the radiation diagram of the antenna, which would be weighted by the radiation diagram, and it is integrated in the whole solid atom. is is So we can calculate the temperature of the antenna or the contribution to the temperature of the antenna of an interference source such as the sun. If there are more interference sources, we would have to add another interference. If there is now a satellite around here, which is seen with a solid angle of the satellite, then we would have to add the same, but with the temperature of one of the satellite, the solid angle with which the satellite is seen and the directivity of the antenna. foreign Imagine that this receptor has a sensitivity that the signal is 40 dB. If the noise is too big, if it is less than 40 dB, the signal of the noise is no longer... And finally... The transmission station, let's remember it, because you have already seen it. Let's suppose we have two antennas, the transmitter antenna and the receiver antenna. We have a transmitted power here, a part of this is delivered, a part of this is dissipated, a part of this is radiated, from this, there will be a power finally delivered to the receptor. Here there will be a power dissipated. Here there will be a possible adaptation by polarization. And here there may be a disadaptation of impedances. Then we will have a distance R between the two antennas and we will also have a directivity of the receiving antenna, the transmitting antenna and the directivity of the receiving antenna. With all that, the transmission equation gives me the relationship between the transmitted power and the received power. A balance of powers of the entire complete radio link, from the transmitter to the receiver. is and So, what we are going to do here is to look at how we relate the received power with the transmitted power. correct correct? Let's continue. The radiation potential is divided by the distance between the transmitter and the receiver, whichated power is the transmitted power, reduced by 2, this is theissive power, to reach the radial frequency I have two losses, one and two. This is the difference in transmission and this is the difference in transmission due to the need of sonic losses. This is the radial force. And now, all this can be joined in one term, which is lambda divided by 4pr, all squared, by the directivity of the concept, efficiency, which is the sum of the sum of the perception. the and the transmitted power. Let's put it in order. In the end, we have the received power and the transmitted power. The more power transmitted, the more power received. That's the rule. If I give you 1000 watts, you give me 100 watts, you give me more power. This is something that increases the power. The more power transmitted, the more more radiation. Things that increase the power. The directivities of the transmitter and the receiver. The directivities of the transmitter and the receiver because they will be greater than one. Any antenna, like a coco, has one directivity. If it does not have more directivity, that increases. Why? Because the more directivity the antenna, the more concentration of radiation. With respect to an isotropic, which would radiate in all directions, and this one, which would receive all directions, the more direct, the better. I will receive more power because less will escape me by directions not of the cell. Therefore, we put below two things that raise the power. All this is are guarantees. The higher the received power, the better. Now, losses of power. I have losses of power due to misadaptation of impedance in transmission and reception. Losses of power due to sonic loss in transmission and reception. and and the other one is the receptor, because they don't have the same antennae. And finally, what is left? The energy is dispersed, and the greater the distance, the more energy is dispersed. All this is loss, all this is gain, all this is loss. The most frequent way to put this, and we have already finished, is to join the transmission directivity with the efficiency of sonic losses, and that gives rise to what? To the gain, because we have the transmitted power, the gain of the transmitter, this, we join with this, which would be the gain of the receptor and then we get the loss of free space, the polarization and the deviation of the transmission and the receptor. This is the most common form of the transmission equation. But this is also fine. I should've used a... I I'm going to ask you a question. This is the test that Alejandro put in the last exam he took. This is from April April 2023. Question 1. Is it good? How many hours do you have to do this? Three. Now, for the fifth. Okay. You don't have them without answers. I'm going to update it on the web without the marked answers Okay, let's see. The difference between the region of distant radiated fields and the region of close radiated fields is the region 3. And this is the region 2. Between the region 3 and the region 2, the difference is... I'm going to do it in it and take it to the evident. In the 2 and 3 regions, the fields have a square partition, in the 2 and 3 they have a square partition. In the 1 region, the fields have a radial component and an electric field, and in the 2 and 3 region they don't have a radial component. And the difference between the 2 and 3 regions is that in the 2 region the field varies 2 the distance varies and in the 3 it like this. Question 2, it says, the field of an antenna is E is equal to E sub 0 by L minus JKR by J divided by R squared by R unit plus 1 divided by r squared by r unit, plus 1 divided by r by kta unit. The polarization is... for a I I don't know if I'm doing it right, but... I know this is all in the book. This, not exactly, but I think you'll learn more. I'll tell you in the next day, I'll explain what I'm doing, but... I think you'll learn more, because if you don't see the same, you won't know what you're doing. I Yes. I Okay. is linear. So foreign I don't like this question. If I were a student I would ask, but are you asking me the third question? It's a weird question. I'm not going to do it because I don't like the way it is. Question four. For an antenna radiating in free space, which of the following parameter specifications is incorrect? The gain can be 0.5 in an antenna, it can be, but the directivity can not be 0.9, the directivity is always greater than 1. The isotropic would be a diagram in the form of a sphere with directivity 1, any other diagram that is a little more direct than a sphere, its directivity is greater than 1. Instead, as the gain is greater than 1, in to and the third book and the book about coprocolisation too. I have to say the height if you want. It's the same as this one, but with others... I want to see the antenna. No, no, no, no. A signal antenna. You dictate it to me. A signal antenna in the origin of the coordinate. Radius... Radius in a field of the form... I parentheses In polarization, there must be a wave that goes through the Y axis so that there is maximum polarization curve. Ok. Okay. This is the wave that radiates the antenna in the origin of coordinates. What we have to see is the wave that radiates this antenna in that direction with which polarization it comes out. We will have to particularize this in the direction of the FI, which is Tx equals pi by 2, which is Tx equals pi by 2, phi equals pi by 2. So we are going to particularize the wave carried by the antenna in Tx equals pi by 2, phi equals pi by 2. And then we would have, 0 to the power of pi is 1, so we have 1, because it is unit, plus j, 1, plus cos pi is 0, is equal to minus jkr divided by r. So, sub zero times theta plus j phi is equal to minus jkr divided by r. Then the wave radiated by my antenna in that direction of exit is this. What polarization does that have? Let's separate it into real part and imaginary part. The real part is vector and the imaginary part is phi. is because the options that you give with that We know that the cell of the bear is circular. I have to put here this wave that has to reach the circular polarization. Because this receives with polarization, receives with circular polarization, the domino has to reach with circular polarization. But the sign has to be the same. So we will have to see the sign of this. The sign is that P sub i, vector product of P sub r, goes in the direction of propagation. It goes in the direction of propagation better. If you want, you can substitute and check if it sounds more or less than zero. What I like to do is that I leave this one there, this is the X axis and this is the Z axis, my antenna is here, and the wave that scratches, this wave that comes out, that comes out, has a real part that goes in a dictum, and an imaginary part that goes in a function. foreign This is equal to negative R unit. This is r, almost never do it. If you want to do the question, I would draw it and I think you'll like it. I don't understand a problem from last year. Problem. I I have a question. When you read the radiation diagram, sometimes it was multiplied by the cosine that you were multiplying. And in that diagram, in the electric field that radiates, it is cosine of hecta plus 1 times f of kx times g of ky. Because that cosine of plus 1, is it not taken into account because there is already 1 and the cosine does not affect when you multiply? No, it is not taken into account. It is a diagram of this type. one If we have a current thread, this is the axis in which the wire is. If the wire is in axis z, it is in axis z. If the wire is in axis x, it is in axis x. And it will have a revolution symmetry around the axis in which the wire is. If the wire is there, it is in revolution symmetry. If the wire is in axis z, it is in axis z. If the wire is in axis x, it is in axis x. And if it is an opening, there is no revolution symmetry. is foreign The Z axis or the perpendicular to the opening. If the normal opening is outside the Z axis, the opening is here. And that is outside the Z axis. When it is a nest or a slot and we lower the invisible margin, this is where the nest or the slot is. And when it is an opening, this is where the opening is and this is outwards. In openings, the bottom part is the most important. Yes, yes, yes, this is where it is. Neither in opening nor in slot. Because there is no symmetry there. Ifs more than one, it with the graphical method, we get this. We say it's u and we draw 1 plus u divided by 2. We draw 1 plus u divided by 2 where u is the detector, U will vary between negative 1 and 1. And if we draw 1 plus U divided by 2, that is a line. Here it is 0.5 and here it is 1. is and now we go down the maximum, here one that was 1 plus 1 squared. No, it's like this. This is 0, this is 0.5 and this is 1. Because when u is 0, it's 5. When u is 1, it's 1. And when U is minus 1, it is 0. So, this is a wall. In this direction, I have a radiation wall. Here is 1. Here is 0 Z axis. There is a question from the group 3 that they give us. The diagram of the relationship between theta and theta is equal to minus 12, between parentheses, theta, divided by 15 degrees, squared. And that tells you to get the width of A to 3D. That's upside down. What? It's upside down. You should specify it. No, I don't copy it right now, but I suppose it could be. But it's negative. It's upside down. It tells you to calculate the width of A to minus 3D. Correct? Yes. Ok, then... correct 0 0 degrees. This is in degrees, right? 0 degrees. When the texture is 15 degrees, when the texture is 15 degrees, how much is it? Minus 12 degrees. The drop is minus 12 degrees. When the texture isC, it's the same. It's like this. This is the main hole. That's the main hole. That's the maximum. If I go 15º from the center of the eye, the Cdv have already fallen. This is the maximum radiation point, which is Tc equal to 0, that is, in the z axis, it will be a diagram that if we draw it in polar, this was the z axis, it would be a diagram of this type. With an eye like this, this would be the resolution symmetry, this would be 1 or 0 dv, 1, 1, 0, and when I go 15 degrees, it has already fallen to minus 2dB. Correct? The thing is that this is in Cartesian coordinates and this in coordinates around here. And they ask me for the h of A at minus 3 dB. Well, now we have to theta minus 3. We'll call this value theta minus 3. That's when you'll understand. So, minus 12 times theta minus 3 divided by 15 degrees squared equals minus 3. El menos con el menos me va. Teta menos tres partido por quince grados al cuadrado es igual a tres partido por doce, es lo mismo que un cuarto. Luego, theta minus 3 will be 15 degrees divided by 2. And the radius of the axis minus 3 db will be the double of this. The width of A to the power of minus 3dB is 2 times this, minus 3, which is 5. If you want I can do more. foreign If you give me tutorials, I will give you 4 different ones. If you give me 4 tutorials, I will give you 4. And if you give me 100, I will give you 100 per week. No. I I You can sit in the middle. I foreign But what I said was, if you, before the practice, teach them. If you wait for the practice, you let them pass. But if you pass presentation, but that's it, right? I'll be back. Okay.\"}\n",

This is the bedroom. This is the bedroom. This is the bedroom. This is the bedroom. This is the bedroom. This is the bedroom. I've come and you've recorded it. There are many teachers who say, what? I have students to record my classes and not to record me. But you don't teach on time. You come on time. You come on time. Many people come, but many don't usually come. If you didn't record a lot, they would come. So, the students are the ones who say. I always say, yes, you have a fuller class, but those you don't want to come, why don't you come? Because few people come and they don't want to come. We record videos at home and then we have to do the production. Maybe we don't need to do a lot of online and that's it. We record what interests us and if I have any questions about something, I'll see. I've always thought that videos are fine and that it would be nice to record the classes. But I think that the material is not enough, not in a place, not in front of the camera. I don't know, because I have people with me, and I don't know, I don't know. I also see that the classes come with much better grades than those who have not. That's what the energy department did. They did a statistical analysis and those who had passed the exam were in the 80s, and those who hadn't, they didn't pass. So, yes, everything is proven. If you have a class, you approve and get a grade. If you have a student who has passed the exam though she didn't come, she also dropped out. It can't be. But... I asked you to come but you didn't. I'll check it out tonight. I'm glad I didn't fail. I'm going to see what's going on. How bad is it? I'm going to work today. You're going to do a test. I'm going to do a test. I'm going to do a test.

I had this one. I take this from here. Now, I take this from here, because I have calculated both of the same. I take the sum of both. Now, to calculate I have to take both of the same thing. The sum of both. Now, to calculate I have to take this one and this one. This one and this one. It would be a paper twist all the time. I would say, I'm going to take this, this, this. But well, I mean, I have to take the sum of both. Problem? There are no problems, but I'm afraid. I'm afraid that I'm going to have a problem with the board. Yes, me too. There are no problems. What a bummer! I'm going to put the camera here. I'm going to put the camera here. I'm going to put the camera here. I'm going to put the camera here. I'm going to put the camera here. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm going to put now the monopole. We have seen everything about monopoles. We are going to talk about about dipoles. Let's talk about monopoles. A monopole is a dipole medium, so that one of the wires of the transmission circuit to half of the tube, half arm, and the other wire to a mass plane. In principle, if it is a polygonal cone, it will be a mass plane that extends to infinity and also has an infinite conductivity which obviously never happens in practice but well, if we study the ideal monopole at this moment it can be a little bit when the monopole is not ideal it is always, what happens? but we are going to start studying the ideal monopole which would be with a and infinite metal plane. Here we would have the tension, and here the current of the monopole. To study the monopole, what we have to do is apply what? Images. I have the current and the voltage. I have the current and the voltage. I have the current and the voltage. I have the current and the current. Now we are going to apply the image. We have this current thread, which will have an image, which will be a thread in which the current will flow. The current flows from the positive pole to the negative pole. The image of a positive pole is a negative pole, and the image of a negative pole is a positive pole. If a current flows from the positive pole to the negative pole, the current is also in that direction. The image of that current thread is another current thread, but at same distance, with a current of the same direction. And then, the image of a voltage source would be another voltage source where the image of the negative pole is the positive pole, and the image of the positive pole is the negative pole. In reality, it is like having a 2V voltage source and a dipole. To analyze the monopole, the field that radiates the monopole in the upper semi-space, the radiated field is the same as the one in the upper semi-space. We can calculate this field with the original problem or with this equivalent problem, which is this one here, where the radiated field is bipolar, of the same magnitude, which is monopolar, of the same magnitude of arm, but with two arms, and with a current and a secondary voltage. And this would produce the same radiated field in this upper arm than the monopole. We can then compare here the characteristics of the monopole and the bipolar. The characteristics of monopole and dipole Okay, so, characteristics. The current in the dipole and the current in the monopole are the same. The voltage in the dipole and the voltage in the monopole are the same. Okay, so we compare dipole and monocole. The impedance of the dipole will be the product of the current and the voltage. In the monocole, the impedance will be half. We put the current and in the middle. Therefore, for example, what was the radiation resistance of a type H equal to alpha 4? If the type was H equal to alpha 4, we would say that its antenna impedance, if you remember, was 73 plus J43. We saw it yesterday. What would be the difference between a monopole of h equal to the fourth and a half? The difference would be 73 plus the 43, and the other half. The difference is half. The half that the decodero of the same H. More things. Directivity. The maximum directivity of the dicholo. What relation does the maximum directivity of the monocholo have with that of the dicholo with the same value of H? For example, let's imagine that the regression of the dipole is this. And if it's a dipole h equals to 4, then its maximum directivity would be 1.64. Correct? What would be the directivity of a monopole of h equals to 4? correct oh yeah yeah yeah If I had a monopole, what would it be? It would be the same, but only in the upper half-space. Because I have said that this problem is useful for me to know what is around the monopole in the upper half-space. Below, where there is nothing, because I also have a metal plate, it would be just this. So, if this had a directivity, if it were h equal to a factor of to 1, which is 4, what directivity does it have? The same is not true. For example, an isotropic antenna, if I now turn it into a sphere, what directivity does it have? If it is a tropical system, and we have a sphere, what is the direction? 1. If it is only a half-semi-sphere? 1 is a tropical system. If it is only a half-sphere? The radiation has to be greater than 1, it can't be less than 1, it's impossible. It would be twice as high. Remember that there were some questions about whether it was like an orange gash and whether it was 4 times a atom. Here it is concentrating the radiation in the middle of the space. Notice that all the power was going here, here, here, here and now this, the power changes only here, here, here in the middle, slowly, because the directivity is a double slowly concentrates the net in the middle so this, directivity would be the double ok? well, what else? Effective length. The pole will have whatever it is. For example, this is the effective length of the pole. This is the opposite. It would be 2x4x64. This is the effective length of the pole would be 2.64. This is the effective magnitude of the lambda divided by pi. We saw it yesterday. Let's consider another thing. The effective magnitude of the lambda divided by pi. What would be the effective magnitude of the monopole? Remember that the effective magnitude was in this formula. The antenna voltage was less than the incident field by the effective dose. So if we have an incident field of an external antenna that incides in the dipole, it produces a voltage of 2V. If it produces a tension, it goes up. But if it inflects on the monopole, the tension it produces is half. Therefore, if the tension produced by the monopole is half, it is because the effective force is half. Therefore, the effective force is half, and the monochrome is the objective area in the dipole divided by 2. In this case, when we multiply by the other quarter, the objective area in the monochrome is the high part divided by 2. The half. And the last one, the effective area. The effective area... The effective area... The effective area, if we use this formula, the effective area is eta, by the square root of the effective area, divided by 4 times the rejection area. In the case of the effective logic, divided by 4 times the projection efficiency. In the case of a monopole, we are going to develop it. In the case of a monopole, the effective logic of the monopole is the pentipole, divided by 2. And the variance efficiency is half of the amplitude. The amplitude of the dipole is half, and the impedance is half, or the resistance of the radiation is half. Therefore, we will have eta times the amplitude of the dipole squared, divided by 4 times the resistance of the radiation of the dipole, and we will have 2 in the numerator and 4 in the denominator. Because this 2 goes up to the multiplicator and this 2 to the square goes down to the divisor. In the end, this is the effective area of the dipole, divided by 2. For the monopole, it would be the fictive area of the dipole divided by 2. Ok? Well, this and this, this is a case of an ideal monopole. A case of an ideal monopole. in the case of an ideal monopole. Well, everything is in the case of an ideal monopole, but especially these two things. Because in the case of a real monopole, I'm going to put a little bit of glue on the back of the box. I'm going to put a little bit of glue on the back of the box. I'm going to put a little bit of glue on the back of the box. I'm going to put a little bit of glue on the back of the box. I'm going to put a little bit of glue on the back of the box. If the effectiveness is double, the effective area must be double, not half. And it doesn't meet this requirement because it's an infinite antenna. Because this is a consequence of reciprocity theorem,'t apply to infinitely it or not. But if it were a real monopole, a theoretical monopole with an infinite mass plan, this is what happens. This is the left side, this is the right side. But be careful, this is not what happens. In a real monopole case, we can have two cases. Case 1, for example, a ship with a monopole. It is by the sea, and the sea is not infinite, but it is quite large. Almost half the ocean. We could consider it to be infinite. In fact, there is nothing infinite. Even the universe is finite. That's what physicists say. The concept of infinity is very indisputable. It is large enough to be considered infinite. Or that's what the public has seen. What happens is that conductivity is not infinite. Conductivity is finite. Because the water is conductive, but it is not a perfectly conductive plane. So, in this case, the conductivity is not infinite. In this case, what would happen is that the radiation diagram, even if it were like this, and then cut roughly, with the circuit that is made there, something would be radiated downwards. Something like this. So the directivity would not be double. It would be greater than a dipole with the same value of h, but it would not be so much bigger, half way. It depends exactly on how conjectured the water is, etc. Or apart from the fact that it is in its own place. Assuming that the balcony is not there, and that it cannot be above the water, we would see that there would also be self-reaction downwards. But not as much as in the case of the unicorn. but not as much as in the case of unicorns. In this case, we have three ideas to apply. We have case 2, in which we have a monocle, and as we saw yesterday in the Radio Club, we call it a metallic or infinite ground. It can be simply some metallic rods, as well as in the Radio Club, or sometimes, I don't know if you have seen, in some roof of a building, there is a small domeopole and a disc. It is a finite metal plane. In this case, the conductivity is not infinite and the metal plane is not infinite. It is not infinite. In this case, the effect will be a little more aggressive, so it will go down even more, because the metallic plane is not even finite. It is true that this is more conductive than water, because it is metal, water is not so conductive, but it does not have a finite conductivity and in this case it would be a finite conductivity it is related to the directivity in this case for the dipole of Arno for the real dipoleole, yes. More or less, that would be... It would be halfway. The ideal would be double, but it would be double. So that it would reach the same. As it is, it is a big, metal, conductor. But it is degraded with respect to the ideal monopole. The ground is degraded with respect to the monopole and the air. The routers are creating the routers, and the monopoles too. And the ground, the mechanical part of the ground, the air. Ok, now we are going to see the spiral. Spiral. This is the most complicated part. The most complicated? No, this is the most difficult part. We are going to finish this video. I'm going to give you some spielas and then we are going to have a discussion. You have to choose the best one. The most difficult one was the first theme. If you want the theme, it's not that difficult, but there are a lot of concepts there. This is easier. Let's see, spielas. Let's see, spirals. We are going to see two spirals. First, the elemental spiral. An elemental spiral. An elemental spiral is a spiral with a triangular shape, which is the shape of a churro, but it can be any shape, a square, a triangle, a circle, through which a current circulates, let's call it x sub 0, and its dimensions, to be elementary, must be the maximum diameter, let's say, it should be less than lambda divided by 10 to be considered elementary. In the same way that the dipole must be h divided by 20, 2h smaller than lambda divided by 10, here the same criterion. From there we consider that the spiral is elemental. Well, the radiation vector for an elemental spiral, I will not stop, in the notes, because this is the transform of the 3D Fourier of the current is what we saw in the last class. In this case, it turns out that k times r prime is very small, because k is 2pi divided by lambda. Here in this k is 2pi divided by lambda, and r are the distances. But since this is much smaller than lambda, here there will be 1 divided by lambda, and here there will be the distances distances to each point of the thread. Therefore, this will be very small. As it will be very small, we can approximate this by its first two terms of the series of teg. But if we start with the first two terms, because it is very small, the set of terms around 0, if we take L raised to the power of jx, this tends, when x tends to 0, to 1 plus jx plus 0. A set of terms around x equal to 0. x plus x plus x plus x plus x plus x plus x plus x plus x plus x plus x plus x plus x And then, this primitive, which would be two commands, one would be simply to integrate the current, but to integrate the current with a closed curve, it will give me zero, because this current will give me this, this current will give me this, so one wave will be calculated, therefore this one, it will not not produce radiation. So what I have left is this, which is equal vectorial by the unit vector. Because these would be two terms, the integral of J of the volume differential plus the integral of J by Jk of the unit vector. The first is simply the integral of the currents, but the integral of the currents, this is going to be like a closed spiral. As you can see, the spiral is a loop. As you can see it there, it loops. So, finally, we have the integral of J, current, by J K R', and this can be shown by this, where M is the magnetic moment of the spiral, which is the current that is applied by the spiral, which is constant, because it is so small electrically that the current does not give it time to change. It can be that it activates the sub-zero, here minus the sub-zero, here... the current is constant. We consider it constant throughout the spiral. That in the other spiral we will see later does not happen. But here, as it is an elemental spiral, the current is constant. And its magnetic moment is that current through the area of the spiral, where S would be this area, with a normal vector, normal to the spiral, normal to the spiral, following the direction of rotation of the current with the right hand. If I follow the direction of rotation, I would have to paint the colors to make it go up, so I would have to paint it, and giving that center it would go down. In this case, N would be this vector, perpendicular to the surface of the spiral, but in this case down. I have also drawn the current, if I draw it backwards, N would go up, and it would go down. This is the magnetic moment of the spiral. And this is the vector of the spire, which is minus jk eta, divided by minus jkr, divided by the length is minus jk eta divided by minus jkr divided by 4 kr by the components eta and pi of the radiation vector. Where is the radiation vector? The electric radiation vector, because we have a wire, there is no equivalent magnetic current, there is only electric current and the electric reaction vector. And now, a particular case, but be careful that here there are problems of everything, but well, a particular case, the spires can have different angles. One of the problems with this problem is that the spire is not oriented in the xy plane. But in a particular case, the spire is oriented in the xy plane. What would happen in that case? This is the xz, the plane contained in the plane xy, we will assume that the current goes in that direction. What would be the radiated field by that thorn? What would be the radiated field by that thorn? We have to start calculating its radiation vector, which would be Jk, times its magnetic moment, which would be I0, times the area, the area, well, it's a circle, and the square is a square. If it's a square, we divide it by the square. And then, n, what would it be in this case? Z. If we had the correct answer, we would have done it like this. We would have solved it like this. In this case, Z. We have to calculate the vector product. We have to calculate the vector product. Z times the unit vector z. And the second vector, the unit vector r, has components in x, in y, in z. We used this in the first example, when we were preparing the spherical coordinates, I would have, look, sine of theta times cosine of phi times x plus sine of theta times sine of phi times y plus cosine of theta times theta. for Here we can get the common factor in the sine of theta, and I would have sine of theta times negative sine of phi, the unit vector, plus cosine of phi times pi unit. For the United States of America. Ready? So, in this case, the vector of the equation is Jk sub 0 by S times sine of theta times phi unit. This is the vector of variation of the elementary sequence if it is in the plane of the system. If not, then we will have to calculate it. If you study the Planck's Theorem, that would be... and the radiated field would be... minus jk eta, and the derivative of minus jkr, divided by 4, divided by the components theta and phi of the radiation vector. This radiation vector, what component the detected component? None. It only has the phi component. In this case, there is no detected component, only the phi component. What is this? K is a zero by S, by zero detected, by unit field. This would be the radiated field. With an elementary spiral in would be the radial field. With a spiral, and an element that is not difficult to duplicate. Okay? I'll just do something with that... radial field. So, we have to find the solution of this equation. We can put it like this if you want. Does it sound familiar? Is there any antenna that you know that produces this radiation field? Let's see its characteristics. For example, radiation diagram. What would it be? Let's see its characteristics. For example, radiation diagram. What would it be? If we make this a module and normalize it by its maximum value, it would be a delta. And the field one, the square one that diagram is the dode that has directivity 1.5 what antennas have that? a dipole like that elementary are there any other antennas that have that diagram and that directivity? Is there any other antenna that has this diagram and this directivity? The elementary slot. An elementary slot would have this diagram and this directivity. Okay. If it's an electric dipole, dipole, elementary dipole. What do we do? Electric dipole, dipole elemental. Here we put dipole electric, elemental, ok? It has the diagram being detected, and the electric field goes in that direction, correct? Now we are going to put a needle in the metal. The diagram is detected and the electric field is directed in the direction of the hand. In the case of the hand. The electric field is magnetic and here it is the other way around. What happens with an elemental spiral? What would happen if we were to do a spiral in the plane of the Earth? Where does the electric field go? I'm going to show you how to do it. Okay. The elemental radius is like a magnetic dipole. Remember? It is like a magnetic dipole. The elemental radius is like a magnetic dipole. Well, the elemental sphere is like a magnetic unicolon. The elementary sphere is a processor of magnetic unicolons. A magnetic unicolon processor. A magnetic unicolon. And if we had a......a slot like this... How would it be? I take a metal and I make a cut like this. It's a magnetic cut. This cut is a magnetic cut. And it's the same as this. Because the last one was the same as this. The electric spiral is the same as the magnetic pole. The electric spiral is the same as the magnetic pole. I understood that the slot, that is, that we make a very small opening on one side, and therefore the motor is placed in the plastic. The magnetic sphere is larger. This magnetic sphere is the electric field. So, electric field at the end of the... We have to distribute it in all... It always has to be in one of the same shape. Repetitive in the same shape. Okay? So we have this duality. Electric dipole, magnetic dipole, spiral spiral. It's a spiral, it's a magnetic dipole. Well, more things. We know then, for the elemental spiral of the diagram SS, that the directivity is 1.5, more things, well, the variance of the elemental spiral, So this is the C. 20, cada cuadrado por el área al cuadrado. En el caso de que sea, por ejemplo, circular, 20 k squared times the area squared. In the case of, for example, a circular sphere, then it would be 20 pi squared k times A squared. Because in that case the area is P by A squared. This is the resistance of the radius, this in general for any spiral, in any form, rectangular, square, and circular, would be this. And then, the objective objective, which would be 1 divided by the current at the entrance by the components theta and φ of the other direction. That would be 1 divided by I0, we only have the component φ, which would be Jk by the area, by I0, by the sine of θ and by φ. I0 is the specific frequency, and the objective frequency for the elemental frequency is Jk by the area, by the spectral vision, and for Phi, a unit area. Ah, and another thing. This is the radiation frequency, the reactance of this antenna, the spiral, in the case of the elementary coil, how was the reactance? It was very negative. It was capacitive and very negative. In this case, with a spiral, what we have is that it looks like a coil of a single turn, therefore it is inductive. It is an inductive antenna. It will have a small reactance, which is a positive and a negative. It is a small distance, a single turn. It is a small but positive distance. The exact value depends on the thickness of the thread, there are formulas that depend on the material, the conductivity it has, well, it is not worth putting the formula. There is a formula that I have here, which is not worth putting. It is worth simply knowing that it is like a coil. There is a formula, I have it here. Simply know that it is like a coil. If the dipole is capacitive, this is inductive. This is the effective length, and the maximum effective length in the direction of maximum radiation and the effective length in the direction of maximum radiation would be the modulus of the normative perspective in the direction of maximum variation, which is 30.5. The modulus of this normative perspective when theta is 0.5 would be the modulus of detected, it is 1, if it is detected it is 1, if it is not detected it is 1. It is the maximum inductive range of the sphere. The question is if the dipole is capacitive or not. Yes, the dipole is capacitive. If you want to understand it this way, look, to understand it better, think about it. The bipolar reactance is the reactance of a transmission will have a negative distance, very big, very negative. That will be the distance of the dipole. And if I have a spiral, which is a spiral more than this, What is a spiral? What is a spiral more than this? This is a spiral. An elementary spiral, where we have divided by bands in the small. Because it is a spiral. So what is the distance of this? What is the distance of this? Where do we start? From the short circuit. Where is the short circuit? Where is it? Here. The short circuit is here. At some point it is on the short circuit. So we are in the short circuit and I move H divided by lambda, small, in this direction, it produces a positive and a negative reaction this is negative and very big because it is close to infinity and this is close to zero, so it produces a positive but small reaction this is a spiral instead of leaving it open, we have to open it by a circuit and we also separate it, because if we didn't, there would be no rotation. I stretch it and give it a circular shape. I don't want it to be so close, and it doesn't move so much. I separate it a little, but it's a spine. The distance doesn't change much. By opening the arm, or stretching this spine to give it a circular shape, the distance doesn't change much. You can open your arm or stretch this spine to get a circular shape. The distance doesn't change much. The real part appears, because there is the curvature of the reaction. But the distance is not seen in the card. It's like this. Okay. Another interesting feature of the antenna is the efficiency of the sonic waves. And obviously, we will have to see the ratio between these two resistances to see if it is really small. In the case of an elementary dipole, this is small, and in the case of an elementary sphere, this is small. Why is it small? Because we have already seen the other day that for an elementary dipole it was 20pi squared 2h squared by lambda squared. And since h squared by lambda is smaller than 1, the square radiation is small for the elementary particleiral and for the elemental spiral. So here we can see the resistance, the radiation. Well, the radiation resistance in the spiral is greater than in the dipole. So the efficiency of sonic waves, the efficiency of sonic waves in the elemental spiral is much smaller than the efficiency of of the elemental dipole. This is the main disadvantage of the spiral compared to the dipole. Because, for the rest, they are very similar. What is the difference between a dipole and a spiral? It has a very directional diagram. If they are elemental, then with an inductivity of 1.5. What is the main difference? Well, we see that the efficiency of the antenna is the efficiency of the spiral, so then why should we use the spiral? Why does this antenna exist? Well, because it has an advantage, and that is that the only way to have a unidirectional diagram with horizontal linear polarization is the spiral. Because with a dipole I have a unidirectional diagram with vertical polarization, not horizontal. It's impossible. Because if I turn the dipole, it's already unidirectional. I've turned it and I'm rotating it towards the ground and towards the sky. For horizontal polarization there are only two directions, but not a unidirectional plane. Therefore, the spirals are the right plane if I want a unidirectional coverage with horizontal polarization. Sometimes a spiral is also used for localization. I have a spiral, I can put it like this, and I put it on a base that rotates and starts to spin. And then what happens? When the light comes right here, it is entering through a hole in the radiation diagram. Because the dipole has the same diagram, the spiral has the same diagram as a perpendicular dipole to the spiral. So what happens? If I have a spiral and I start to spin, imagine that I want to see where a plane is coming from. And the plane is emitting a signal, and that signal comes in that direction. When I put the spira here, it will be receiving a signal, and here it will be receiving a signal, and it will only receive a that is coming from the wall it is a way to identify where a signal is coming from because there is only one direction well, two, because this is the experience and yes there is only one direction in which I do not receive a signal I receive very little so it is one of the ways one of the uses that is given to the spirit well, then and another thing would be airectional diagram but with horizontal polarization. To improve the efficiency of the alimentary spiral, the spiral with a core of ferrite is used. We take a ferromagnetic material, a magnet, whose magnetic permeability is this one, with a UR greater than 1, of course, but it would not be bad. And now we take the spiral, and instead of giving it a spin, we give it several spins. Around the nucleus of the circuit. And we give it N spins. Ok? What do we have? Here we have a subzero coordinate, here too, here too, it is the same coordinate that enters here and exits here. So I have the same antenna, I have N antennas, N elementary spirals, placed right on top of each other. So that the radiated electric field is N times the one that radiates a single spiral. And also, that radiated electric field will be increased, not only because it has two inspirations instead of one, but it would be increased because having a ferrite nucleus, a phenomenon of amplification of the magnetic flux is produced, which also makes the difference greater. In short, in the end we would have the same directivity, the same diagram, the same antenna, but the effective length would be the one I have with a single spiral without a ferrite core, but multiplied multiplied by mu r and m. And the new radiation resistance would be the one before, but multiplied by mu r and m squared. For the rest, they are the same. So, this one, if we look at its new efficiency of radiation, would be the new resistance of radiation divided by the new resistance of squared times the old resistance of radiation. And the resistance of sonic waves, as I have n batteries, is n times greater. It would be the resistance of a battery, but as there are n batteries, here it increases by n. here it increases by n. What happens? Look, compared to the old efficiency of sonic waves, this we have multiplied by a very large square, by n squared, and this is only by n. Therefore, now this is much larger than this, and the efficiency of sonic public network is increased. This is a way to have a spiral antenna, which has a diagram of the design, but with a good radiation efficiency. When we put it several times, it puts a green light. and with that we can measure the efficiency of the antenna at the end, when you have to design an antenna The most difficult thing is to make it and not to have many fabrics. The most difficult thing is the production of the fabric. A direct diagram's easier. And finally, we will use for the mobile. So, We have a line of transmission and we make a spiral. The transmission line is a little bit circled at the end, and the perimeter is lambda. So all this the lambda. So, let's see how the current would be in this spiral of the perimeter of the lambda. We have a problem here. A problem. A bar. A bar. A bar. A bar. A bar. A bar. A bar. A bar. A bar. A bar. A bar. A bar. This is not small electrically, the field of time varies. Because there is a longitude and a length. If we had the transmission line without closing, and we had a short circuit, this longitude is the length of the medium strip the length of the medium strip is the length of the medium strip ok? then we give it the shape of a spire but in principle it is a transmission line that will have the short strip therefore the force here, how much is it? in the end, in the short strip we don't know but final value of the short. But we know what the voltage is, right? The voltage when it goes from 1 to 0. And here we have a stationary wave, correct? It's a stationary wave. Therefore, the voltage, as it's a stationary wave, here it goes to 0, and the wave after that, where it goes to 0. And then, it be like this. That would be the voltage. And the current? The current, instead, since they are offset, the current here would have a maximum value, here it would be zero, here it would be minus one, and this would be the current of the stationary wave. Therefore, I would have This would be the current of the stationary wave. Therefore, I would have that at the end the current is maximum, here the current would be I sub m, the current would have a maximum value, the current flows in this direction, and here it would have a maximum value in the middle it would be zero, or here it would be zero correct? in the middle it would be zero, and here it would be minus iso-dm or here it would be minus iso-dm So, we have here the matrix, and we have the matrix, and we have the matrix, and we have the matrix, and we have the matrix, and we have the matrix, and we have the matrix, and we have the matrix, and we have the matrix, and we have the matrix, and we have the matrix, and we have the matrix, and we have the matrix, and we have is zero, I could it is zero, here the current goes in this direction and here it is I sub m. If now this current on the left side, instead of defining it up, I define it going down, then the current, instead of being minus I sub m, would be I sub m. I can see it as two threads, two threads, one and the other, that have a current that is zero and I sub m zero, and here can understand as if I had two dipoles, two dipoles, in which the current is 0, 0, and its Vm, 0, 0, and its Vm, 0. So 2 dipoles. As it is a spiral of perimeter lambda, I can see it, I can understand it, as 2 dipoles of medium oscillator. 2 dipoles of half a mole of dielectric, two dipoles of H equal to how many? I can have two dipoles of H equal to how many? Separated by how many? How many are separated? How many are separated? What is the distance of separation between the two? It will be twice the radius of the circumference is 2pi times the radius of the circumference. And the perimeter, 2pi times A, is the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the perimeter of the and then we have two dipoles, which are equal to I sub m, 0, minus I sub m, 0. But nothing would happen, because both halves are independent, and I still consider that I have a current that circulates in the downward direction, and is equal to 0, I sub m, 0, and this one in this direction is equal to 0, minus I sub m, 0, but if I put it in the opposite direction, the current is like a cable. If I say that the current is 2 amps, if I put the arrow in the opposite direction, we would not see that it is less than 2 amps. If I change the direction, instead of saying that it goes up, I say that it goes down. Before it was less than 10 amps, now it is 10 amps. I have to go down, because before it was minus I sub m, now it is I sub m. If I sub m, the truth is that I have the E, because it is already set. The E what? The minus I sub m, it is already set. This minus I sub m was set, it was set. And when I change the direction, it is when I have changed the minus with a plus. And then I have two wires with the same direction of current, and with the same current. I have two dipoles in the same direction, and they have the same distribution. 0 and 0 are equal. I have two dipoles, h is equal to 1 quarter, separated by the partition of the beam. And that is the spiral of the perimeter, which if we have it in the x-plane, in the z-plane, in the fi-plane, in the x-plane, we are going to assume that we have it here, in the length of the perimeter. We have said that this is equivalent to having two dipoles, one here and one here. So, it's like having two dipoles with the same current. So, I ask, what would this radiation diagram look like? For example, up, in the direction of the Fz, the two antennas have the same current, so the wave that comes out, or the ray that comes out of this antenna will be superimposed in phase or counterphase. There will be a constructive or destructive energy going up. To start, a single dipole in this direction is its maximum radiation direction, the z axis, for a dipole located on the x axis. Its diagram is a toroidal, right? It would have a multidirectional diagram, where the maximum field would be in the direction of the z axis, the y axis, of minus i, of minus z. You see? And it would have a radiation wall in the direction of the x axis. That, a single dipole. We have two. Having two, as both have the same identical coefficient with the same phase, they will come out and be added by a constructive interference downwards, because they are the same, one plus one is two. Downwards, the same. Downwards, I have a constructive interference. Or if with a single antenna I have a maximum in that direction, with two I have a maximum in one antenna, in that direction I have a maximum multiplied by 2. In the same field as in one antenna, but multiplied by 2. Because they add up as such. In this direction, on the other hand, I have a null. Because the two antennas have a null of radiation. None of the two fields crosses in this direction. In this direction I also have a null, because neither of the two radiates field. And now, in the direction of FI, what will I have? In the direction of F minus I. I will have one, what radiates... here I have one plus one, 1 plus 1, 2. Here I have 1 plus 1, 2. Here I have 0 plus 0, 0. Here I have 0 plus 0, 0. What goes to 1 plus what goes to the other. 0 plus 0, 0. 1 plus 1, 2. And here I have 1, which is this radius, plus, this comes out with amplitude 1, but it travels a distance, and it travels a distance and it slows down, plus elevated to minus 2k by the distance traveled, which is lambda times pi. This ray comes out with a 1, but when it arrives here it has already shifted to its temporary delay. And this delay, working with phasors, is a shift. The shift is always minus k by the distance traveled. This would be 1 plus e to 2j minus cosine of 2 squared. I'm going to put the new one in the box. I'm going to put it in the box. But I'm going to put less than 2 in the box. Because for it to be 2, it has to be in phase. It has to be in phase, a type of 2B. It would be 2B x 2B. So I'm going to show you how to do it. Why don't you do it with zero? Because the interference is not destructive. For it to go to zero... For it to go to zero, the distance traveled should be pi, 3pi, 5pi. That is, this distance should be of the medium or of 3 lambda medium. And for it to be 2, the distance to travel should be a 2-pile distance. If the distance were lambda, it would be added in phase and this would be 2. If it were lambda medium, it would be added with a slow, destructive difference, it would be zero. As it is neither one nor the other, it is an intermediate factor. It gives one to the other. It is a difference that is neither totally constructive nor totally destructive. In summary, if we have here the plane of the other plane. We have here the diagram of the plane, and we have here the plane of the other plane. We have here the diagram of the plane, and we have here the plane of the other plane. We have here the diagram of the plane, and we have be the size of a peanut in this plane, in the plane IZ, and in the plane XZ, the diagram would be this. And in the XZ plane, how would it be? Upward, the diagram is 2, and downward, it is 2, and in the x-axis, 0. So it would be something like this. If I try to put it in do it, but ok. Ok? So, we would have the antenna coming from the inside of the lamp. Let's say that we would have the maximum up and down, the ventral vent is to the spine. And then, in each plane, it would be this way. Okay. I'm going to go ahead and put the lid on. We have the PDF of the notes. This would be the feeding point. In this case, the X and Y are upside down. But it doesn't matter. I have drawn that this was X and this was Y. But it doesn't matter. This would be X and Y. But it doesn't matter. The point is that you see the current is zero here, and its Vm and its Vm. Zero and its Vm are zero. Zero and its Vm are zero. So I'm going to make two dipoles. A dipole here and a dipole here., up is the phase, the maximum constructive interchange of the diagram in this direction, it is a 1 because the dipoles in this direction do not radiate, so it is a 1 in this direction and in this direction, this plus this with the corresponding phase is not a totally constructive interchange, it is not 2 or 0, it is 1. This would be the diagram of the length of the perimeter. And now we are going to talk about point 4, the antenna of mobile telephony. I will explain this here how to do it. Keep your fingers so you can do it with your phone. I'm going to show you how are the antennas of ILO in mobile phones. This is quite descriptive, so we're going to do equations. These are the first mobile phones. They had a monopod, sometimes they were extensible, sometimes not. The first ones were extensible, then not anymore. They were like stuck inside the phone. They were not extensible. And how was the interaction? Well, it's a monopole. It's a monopole that is not alone. It has a circuit board, where there is metal, and there is a whole metal plate, and all this printed circuit has tracks on one side, but on the other side is the mass plane. where there is metal, and there is another metal layer, because all this is printed circuit, it has tracks on one side, but on the other side is the mass plane. So this dipole is a mass plane that has the shape of a 3D. Taking into account the effect of this mass plane, well, it is more or less a kind of toroid, depending on the mass plane. But well, this would be, in this particular case, a totally rectangular mass plane and a diagram that would depend on it. A real phone is not perfectly rectangular. Each phone has to be simulated and designed by the antenna in the specific positions of that phone, in the generic assumption that it is worth for everyone. This would be the diagram of the omn is worth for everyone. Well, this would be a bit of a diagram of the reaction, a very directional diagram, of a more or less unidirectional monopole, but of this type. And those were the first mobile phones. Of course, then, printed antennas, which no longer protrude from the phone. This is a Xiaomi phone, it's a few years old, but I'll comment on it later. Where were the antennas in this phone? This was one of those that could be removed, now almost no phone can be removed. To open it and see the antennas is more complicated. When you could remove the cover and see them, like this one. What antennas do we have here? Look, here we have three antennas. We have an antenna, which is this one. Do you see the power supply? There it is powered and here we have another one. These are for Wi-Fi and GPS. These are antennas that, when we are at a frequency, a frequency that corresponds to a length of 5 GHz, this part is the one that is called and the one that works. And when the frequency is 900 MHz, the one that works is this one. Not the Wi-Fi, sorry. The other one is the Wi-Fi one, the one that is shorter, the 2.4 Gb, and the GPS one is the 1.5 Gb. This one is the Wi-Fi one, and this one is the GPS one is 1.5 GHz. This will be the WiFi one, and this will be the GPS one. So, according to the frequency, one part works, the other part doesn't. And here we have an antenna that would be the mobile phone one, which has two antennas, one and the other. Why? Because of the HID. There is a cross-path, the GPS antenna comes from above, and it is a multi-way antenna, but the mobile phone is more critical. The GPS can fail, and the mobile phone needs a medium-range connection, so there are two. One and two. So we have reduced it, and we chose the two. And these two, look, this one has two holes, let's see what happens, because it has two holes, and this one has a length of this one and another of this one. So what it does is a spiral of perimeter lambda. All this has a wavelength of one. So this is a spiral of perimeter lambda, and this is what is called an inverted F antenna, which we saw yesterday in the lab. What is this? Let's see these two, which are very common in mobile phones, the inverted F antenna, which is this one here and the one in the other room. This one here, the GPS, would be an inverted monopole. It's just the monopole, instead of being out of the phone, we fold it. It's a monopole and we fold it. We have here all the hardware, parts, all the printed parts, and the monopole, where they come out, and we fold it. When we fold it, what we have is that the current goes here and comes back here. When I do the monopole, the current goes here and comes back here. But here the problem is that the current goes here and comes back here. So let's say that this current is greater than this one, but in some way, they are in the opposite direction of what this one radiates, this one subtracts force. If they were exactly the same, they would be angular. They are not exactly the same, but mine is above this one, so it has a radiation, but we are subtracting force because the same current comes back, if it has a charge, it to the center of the triangle and with less intensity. This is a more intense color, the current is more intense and less, but when you bend the dipole, the antenna loses efficiency. This is called inverted R because it is like an R, but it is constant. The last one is the one with the monochrome, which we bend to make it fit better. And an evolution, which is the one that I use mainly, is the inverted F antenna, or PIFA. The one we see there is a PIFA because it is a patch antenna. This is a NIDO. The PIFA is the same but with patches. We saw yesterday a large antenna, this is a NIDO. The next evolution is, we take it and instead of feeding it here, we have a short circuit and we feed it at this point. To feed at this point, instead of feeding here and feeding here, we put a short, and what happens power of the rotation is much less. Putting it there, what we can see is that it is almost as if we had formed a slot. This is a slot between the conductors, a slot of a progressive load, and a slot of a progressive load. We have two conductors, one progressive wave slot, and the other progressive wave slot. We had a problem with the diagram, which is that instead of a unidirectional, it bends a little upwards. It's a bit what happens. We see that it is a little bent downwards. It's like a progressive wave slot, something similar. and this is the one we have seen in detail, the one we have seen before. So here we have two IFAs for two different frequencies, because it will be a double band, for mobile telephony it will be for 900 and 1800, and then this will be the IFA for 900 MHz and this for 2800. This one probably, to be a double band one, probably, should be even longer to be a LAN-to-MIDI, but all these turns, these widenings, this termination, is what will make it still be resonant, even if it is not a LAN-to-MIDI. And that is a problem of the one who designs the antenna, of how this cross-section is here, here it is thinner, here it widens, here it becomes thinner. All this makes the indifference of the reactance be zero, I insist, even if it is not of the length of the dome. And these two holes, this is to connect it to the mass, short circuit, and this hole this is the power supply. Here we have this inverted F, the ISA for one frequency of mobile here, and here we have the two points of the has a length lambda at the frequency at which this has a length lambda, which is at 1800 MHz, which is also a band, so there is a band, the 1800 band, in which this has a length lambda, and in that case we have a diagram that is the one we have seen before, the constructive frequency up and down, not completely destructive on one side, destructive on the other, which is the one we saw before, the constrictive frequency, up and down, not totally destructive on one side, destructive on the other, is not exactly the same because we have the effect of the mass plane, but more or less, ok? More or less, this is the one of Puyol-Tolambia that we have studied, but then there is another frequency, which is just 900 megahertz, which is half of which this is not a wave length, but half a wave length. So it is a spiral from the middle to the front, which which is not a wavelength but a half wavelength. So it's a length of lambda-medians, which we haven't studied yet, but it's a length of lambda-medians that we have studied. So let's say that 900 MHz would be this diagram, and 800 MHz. So this would be perimeter lambda, perimeter lambda-medians, and mid-band. Both frequencies work. And these are the three antennas, two of them for mobile phone and mid-band, and the other for Wi-Fi and GPS, that were in this telephone terminal. Nowadays, what differences are there in the mobile phone antennas? Well, the main difference is that, for example, the iPhones, if you see that there is a small ring, there, or some had, that is, that band there and metallic, it is a metal case. Before, the back case was made of plastic. In old cars, the back case was made of plastic. That's why the radiation was not a problem. Then they start to put aluminum on the back so that the heat is better. And while the radiation is not good, they put those gloves. That's a difference. I don't know why, but while they appear, they have to be in those bands. That's a difference. With the telephones, this one has a plastic cover, which is a bit damaged, there was no problem to take it off, it was covered with plastic. That's on one hand. And that makes the antennas stick to those slots. And another thing is that there are usually more antennas. So instead of having only one mobile phone antenna, because in a certain band, they would have this and this, so we have two, but now there are usually five antennas, easy on a phone, and routers, and mobile phone stations, and routers also have several antennas. The routers that have one, there are routers that have 3, 4, 5. And the mobile phone companies also have several antennas. Why do they have so many antennas? Because of the MIMO. The MIMO is... The MIMO is... The problem is that there are multiple inputs and multiple outputs. What does that mean? It means that in a radio channel we have, let's imagine, 5 transmitting antennas, because there is a network, a radio station, and my mobile phone, the diagram would be one-dimensional. If I have a dipole, the diagram would be one-dimensional. The one of the transmitter and the one of the transmitter. With five antennas, I can get five direct diagrams. Feeding them with a progressive space, with five progressive spaces, with five different signals that I can feed in each of the 5 antennas and I can get 5 different diagrams. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. And the third is the same. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. So what happens? Maybe, in post-processing, I capture the signals, the five antennas, I digitize them, I do an analog-digitized processing, and then, in the computer, in the circuitry of the projector, I process those signals, and, for example, imagine that here is a statue, or not, but that there is a direct beam, and here is a direct beam and a reflected beam that reflects this wall. So I take the signal of the direct beam and I add the signal of the reflected beam with a certain delay. The signal that would come out of this diagram and the signal that would come in through this diagram. I add it with the right delay so that it is added in phase and then I am getting to improve the signal. And then the noise signal improves. I improve the noise signal a lot. If I add a reflection and I add it too, I improve it even more. I test that I post-process by adding, because there are many channels, here there are 25 channels, there are 5 outputs and 5 inputs. There are 25 possibilities. So, with those 25 possibilities, adding them, or processing them in a proper way, depending on how the channel is used, and that in real time, I can get, add those 25 that interest me, with the right result, and greatly improve the noise signal. Or, with the same noise signal, improve the coverage and distance and that is the NINJA, that is multiple 5, multiple 9 this is explained in a teaching of communication in the master if it is the master the first, in the teaching when they explain it is to signal signal is already in, of me what is the signal, I don't know if there are antennas, but you have to know that the mobiles and routers have more. There is even now a new technique, a new nut, the MIMO, which is a multi-user MIMO. It is a router, and what we do is that for each of these, I send a different signal. Not the same signal, with different diagrams, but with each diagram, the signal 1, the signal 2, the signal 3, the signal 4, the signal 5. And this signal 1 goes to terminal 1, 2, and 3. So for different users, knowing where they are, here is one with a mobile phone, and here I create the data that I want. So I use that output diagram, which is still there, with signal 1. And the other,, that is still there, to show one. And the other, there. So, it's like a digital processor. I'm going to do it. A question? No, it's not to hold up. I'm going to come back. I'm going to do it again. I'm going to have to do this to hold on. I'm going to have to do this to hold on. I'm going to have to do this to hold on. I'm going to have to do this to hold on. I'm going to have to do this to hold on. I'm going to have to do this to hold on. I'm going to have to do this to hold on. I'm going to have to do this to hold on.

I'm going to have to do this to hold on. it was the worst I've done in my whole career. It was good, right? Let's see, I wanted more, but well did it. I'll ask you later. I'll upload the notes and you'll know. I'm sorry. I don't have the height. You don't have to be ashamed. I'm proud of what I've done. I should be ashamed of myself. I should be ashamed of myself. I should be ashamed of myself. I should be ashamed of myself. I should be ashamed of myself. I should be ashamed of myself. but I'm proud of what I have. I'm not going to get mad at myself for not being able to do it. Yeah, that's true. If you see it as a positive thing, it's a good thing. But don't get frustrated. No, no, no. I'm not going to get mad at myself for not being able to do it. I'm fine with that. Well, that's it. That's it. Thank you very much. I'm going to go in. Okay. and and Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
